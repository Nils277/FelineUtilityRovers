Kerbetrotter Ltd. is happy to announce its newest creation from the Feline Utility Rover series: The Lynx Rover.  
A medium sized versatile rover that is capable to operate independently in the harshest environments. It is mainly  
designed to operate on other planets, but also in the outback of Kerbin. Depending on your configuration it can  
contain crew cabins, a laboratory or even bellowed joints to be more flexible in difficult terrain.

## Instructions

For instructions on how to use the hitches and joints, please take a look at the **KSPedia** entry of Feline Utility Rovers

The hitches and joints are locked by default when you first launch your vessel. You have to click "Unlock" in the  
right-click menu to unlock them.

The Hover Engines can be controlled with the controls for the Wheels to *accelerate and steer*. *Lateral movement and  
height changes* can be made with the controls for *RCS*. Please also visit the **KSPedia** for more information.
